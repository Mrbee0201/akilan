    <p>Two children have died in Madhya Pradesh’s Shahdol district in the last four days after they were allegedly branded with a hot iron as part of a treatment to cure ailments, reported PTI on Sunday.

        The first death was reported on Wednesday. The infant’s mother, a resident of Kathotia village in Sinhpur, had told authorities that her child was unwell so she took her to a woman faith healer who branded her more than 50 times with a hot iron.

    <p>watchful eye of the British. These Indians, all indentured labourers, had come to the archipelago in search of fortune but found themselves caught in a difficult existence. Their fervent hope was that the person they had gathered at the port to welcome, Manilal Doctor, would help in their struggle against the British with his legal knowledge.

        “We made preparations to welcome him to the best of our abilities,” Totaram Sanadhya, an indentured labourer who would become a Hindu priest, wrote in his book My Twenty One Years in the Fiji Islands. “On the day he was welcomed, there was so much happiness for the Fiji-dwelling Indians that it cannot be told.” The excitement among the gathered crowd began to grow as the passengers began to disembark. “On the face of many Indians drops of sweat glistened, from hard work and running around. Oh! That was so beautiful,” Sanadhya wrote. “There wasn’t even space for a sesame seed, men pressed together filling it.”</p>
